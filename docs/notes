How is a cs3500.threetrios.model.Card represented?
cs3500.threetrios.model.Card class
  Fields:
    String name
    int attackNorth, attackEast, attackSouth, attackWest
        //accounts for attack values
Methods:
  validCardAttackValue() // called in constructor and validates if the attack value is between range 1-9 inclusive

QUESTION:   when an attack value is 10 it prints out A so should the validCardAttackValue check for the range 1-10 inclusive
            -> our plan for later is when we create a toString() we would have it print 'A' when the value is 10

cs3500.threetrios.model.Direction enum (NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST) //Question: Will this direction be used anywhere else, or just in our card class



How is a cs3500.threetrios.model.Grid represented?
  Inner class called cell that can be either a hole or card cell

Methods:
  isEmpty() //validates if cell is available -- makes sure it is not a hole or already contains a card

Other ideas: 
Create a cell type enum: HOLE, CARDCELL
